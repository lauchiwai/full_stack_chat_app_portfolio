# üöÄ Full-Stack Real-Time Communication & Learning Platform

This is a full-stack project independently developed by me, integrating real-time chat, language learning (vocabulary/articles), and AI Q&A functionality. The project adopts a microservices architecture, demonstrating comprehensive skills from frontend, backend to DevOps.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Highlights

### üîê Security & Architecture
- **Dual JWT Authentication System**: Implemented Access Token and Refresh Token mechanism to ensure user security and seamless refresh.
- **Microservices Communication**: Main backend service communicates asynchronously with AI service through message queue (RabbitMQ), achieving service decoupling.
- **Outbox Pattern**: Ensures eventual consistency between database updates and message delivery in distributed systems.

### ‚ö° Real-time & User Experience
- **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**: Used for real-time data push, providing smooth user experience.
- **RAG AI Q&A**: Combined Qdrant vector database with FastAPI to create an intelligent Q&A bot based on custom knowledge base.
- **Responsive Web Design (RWD)**: Frontend uses Vue 3 and SCSS to ensure perfect experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

### üöÄ Deployment & Operations (DevOps)
- **Containerization**: All services are containerized using Docker for easy development, testing, and deployment.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Established automated build, test, and deployment pipelines for each service.
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Implemented CSP headers on frontend to effectively defend against XSS and other web attacks.
